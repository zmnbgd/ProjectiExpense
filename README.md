DAY 37


* @Published publishes change announcements automatically.
* @StateObject watches for those announcements and refreshes any views using the object.
* sheet() watches a condition we specify and shows or hides a view automatically.
* Codable can convert Swift objects into JSON and back with almost no code from us.
* UserDefaults can read and write data so that we can save settings and more instantly.
